- name: Paul Morris
  degree: B.S. Chemistry, B.S. Applied Mathematics, The Evergreen State College.
  about: When not on campus, you’ll find me playing competitive racquetball on the OSU team, cruising around on a loud motorcycle, painting, and getting lost in the woods. I like to think my home away from home is alongside the elk and rain in the Olympic National Forest. 
  research: developing mathematical models and machine learning algorithms to improve and curate nanoporous materials for gas sensor arrays.
